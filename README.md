# heterotic-dft
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks written in **Haskell** as part of my PhD research in string theory.

These notebooks calculate properties (masses, left and right momenta, KK momenta and winding numbers, phases) of heterotic string states in different group representations and for different symmetry groups.


‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** These notebooks are *messy* and constantly evolving ‚Äî they are actively used in ongoing research! Expect live, work-in-progress code :-)



## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
To run these notebooks, you will need:
- [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/)  
- [IHaskell](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell) Jupyter kernel
